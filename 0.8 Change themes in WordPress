////////Change themes in WordPress////////

To change themes in WordPress, follow these steps:
From the WordPress Dashboard:
1. Log into your WordPress admin panel (usually yourdomain.com/wp-admin).
2. Go to Appearance > Themes.
3. You’ll see all the installed themes. To switch:
Hover over the theme you want to activate.
Click the Activate button.
To add and use a new theme:
1. Go to Appearance > Themes > Add New.
2. Browse or search for a theme.
3. Click Install, then Activate once it's done.
To upload a theme (from a .zip file):
1. Go to Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme.
2. Click Choose File, select the .zip file, and click Install Now.
3. Click Activate after installation.
Let me know if you’re using a specific theme or builder like Elementor, and I can tailor the steps.
