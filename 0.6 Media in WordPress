///////Media in WordPress//////////

In WordPress, media refers to files like images, videos, audio, and documents (e.g., PDFs) that you can upload and use in your posts, pages, and theme. 
All media files are managed in the Media Library.

How to Create (Upload) Media in WordPress
You can upload media in several ways:
1. Through the Admin Dashboard
Go to Dashboard > Media > Add New.
Click "Select Files" and choose files from your computer, or drag and drop them.
The files are now added to the Media Library and can be reused anywhere.
2. While Editing Posts/Pages
Open a post or page.
Click the "Add Media" button above the editor.
Upload a new file or choose from existing ones in the library.
Click "Insert into post" to add it.

How to Use Media
In Posts/Pages
When inserting media into content, you can set:
Alignment (left, center, right, none)
Size (thumbnail, medium, large, full)
Link options (link to media file, attachment page, or none)
In Themes/Custom Code
You can get media URLs via the Media Library and use them in templates. Example in PHP:
<img src="<?php echo wp_get_attachment_url($attachment_id); ?>" alt="Image">

Tips
Use descriptive file names and alt text for better SEO.
You can organize media using plugins (WordPress doesn't support folders natively).
Optimize images before uploading to improve site speed.
Do you want help with inserting media in a custom theme or plugin too?
