////////Editor plugin in WordPress///////////////

Hereâ€™s how you can use Gutenberg (Block Editor) or the Classic Editor plugin in WordPress, depending on your preference:
---
1. Using the Gutenberg (Block Editor)
The Gutenberg editor is the default editor in WordPress (since version 5.0). It uses a block-based system where each paragraph, image, heading, etc., is a block.
How to Use It:
1. Create or Edit a Post/Page: Go to Posts > Add New or edit an existing post.
2. Add Blocks: Click the "+" icon to add blocks like paragraphs, headings, images, buttons, etc.
3. Move Blocks: Use the drag-and-drop handles to reorder blocks.
4. Block Settings: Click on any block and use the sidebar on the right to customize (like changing font size, color, etc.).
5. Preview & Publish: Use the Preview button to see how it looks, then click Publish or Update.
Useful Tips:
Use the / command to quickly insert blocks (e.g., type /image to insert an image block).
You can create Reusable Blocks for repeating content.

2. Using the Classic Editor Plugin
If you prefer the older interface (like a Word-style editor), you can use the Classic Editor plugin.
How to Install and Use:
1. Go to Plugins > Add New
2. Search for "Classic Editor".
3. Install and activate it.
4. Once activated, it will replace the block editor with the classic one.
How to Switch Between Editors:
After installing Classic Editor, go to Settings > Writing.
Choose whether to use the Classic Editor by default or allow users to switch between Classic and Block editor.

Switching Back to Gutenberg
If you want to switch back to Gutenberg after using Classic:
Deactivate the Classic Editor plugin.
The block editor will automatically become the default again.
