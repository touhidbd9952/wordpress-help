In WordPress, a post is a piece of content, typically used for blog entries, news updates, or chronological content. It’s one of the default content types in WordPress (along with pages, media, etc.).

What Is a Post in WordPress?
Posts are dynamic content entries.
They are displayed by date, with the newest at the top.
Posts can be organized using categories and tags.
They show up in your site's blog feed, archives, and search results.
Posts can have comments enabled.

How to Display Posts on Your Site
1. On Your Homepage (Blog Page)
By default, WordPress shows latest posts on the homepage.
Or go to Settings > Reading, then set:
Your homepage displays: “Your latest posts”.
2. Using a Loop in a Theme File (PHP)
To display posts manually in your theme:
<?php
$args = array(
    'post_type' => 'post',
    'posts_per_page' => 5
);
$query = new WP_Query($args);
if ($query->have_posts()) :
    while ($query->have_posts()) : $query->the_post(); ?>
        <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
        <div><?php the_excerpt(); ?></div>
    <?php endwhile;
    wp_reset_postdata();
else :
    echo '<p>No posts found.</p>';
endif;
?>
3. Using a Block Theme or Page Builder
With block themes, use the Query Loop Block.
With Elementor, use the Posts Widget to display posts visually.
