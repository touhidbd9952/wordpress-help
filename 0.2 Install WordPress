///////install WordPress//////////////

To install WordPress, you can follow these general steps. Let me know if you're installing locally (e.g., XAMPP/Laragon) or on a live server (cPanel/VPS), and I can tailor the instructions more specifically.

2. Upload Files to Server
Localhost: Move the unzipped folder to your web server’s root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP, www for Laragon).
Live Server: Use FTP (like FileZilla) or cPanel File Manager to upload the files to your public_html or a subfolder.
