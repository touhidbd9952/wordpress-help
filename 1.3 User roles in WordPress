Manage categories, tags, and moderate comments.
Cannot manage plugins, themes, or users.
3. Author
Can publish, edit, or delete only their own posts.
Upload files (e.g., images).
Cannot create pages or moderate comments.
4. Contributor
Can write and edit their own posts, but cannot publish them.
Cannot upload files.
Posts must be reviewed and published by an Editor or Admin.
5. Subscriber

Would you like to customize roles or create a new one?
To set user roles in WordPress, you can do it in a few different ways — through the admin dashboard, using code, or via plugins. Here's how:
---
1. Using the WordPress Admin Dashboard
1. Go to Users > All Users.
2. Click on the user you want to edit.
3. Scroll down to the “Role” dropdown.
4. Select a role (e.g., Subscriber, Contributor, Author, Editor, Administrator).
5. Click “Update User”.
---
2. When Adding a New User
1. Go to Users > Add New.
2. Fill in the required fields.
3. Choose a role from the "Role" dropdown.
4. Click “Add New User”.
---
3. Using Code (e.g., in functions.php)
You can assign a role programmatically:
$user = new WP_User( $user_id );
$user->set_role( 'editor' );
To add multiple roles:
$user = new WP_User( $user_id );
$user->add_role( 'author' );
---
4. Using a Plugin
If you want more control (custom roles, permissions, etc.), use a plugin like:
User Role Editor
Members
Advanced Access Manager
These let you create custom roles and manage capabilities with a UI.
