Click Update or Save.
5. To remove a widget, click Remove or drag it out of the widget area.
Method 2: Using the Customizer

2. Click on Widgets.
3. Choose the widget area (Sidebar, Footer, etc.).
4. Edit, add, or remove widgets as needed.
5. Click Publish to save changes.

If youâ€™re using a page builder plugin (like Elementor or WPBakery), widgets might be managed differently. Let me know which theme or page builder you're using if you want specific steps.
